        <h4>Do this</h4>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Soak the beans overnight. Drain the water and put the beans in a pot.<br> 
                Top up with about 1.8 liters of new water and salt. The water should cover the beans.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Peel and cut the onion in half and the sausage into thick slices.<br> 
                Split the pepper and remove the stem and core.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Add onion, sausage and paprika to the pot.<br> 
                Bring to a boil and simmer with the lid on for about 40 minutes or until the beans are almost tender.<br> 
                The time depends on how big the beans are and how long they have been soaking.<br> 
                If foam forms at first, remove it with a spoon. Top up with more water if necessary.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Pick up the cooked onion and pepper. Peel off the skin of the pepper and chop both vegetables.<br> 
                Put them back in the pot.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Make the rescue. Heat the sunflower oil in a frying pan. <br>
                Add the flour and let it sizzle while stirring. Remove from the plate and add the paprika powder.<br> 
                Stir to a thick consistency and pour into the pot. Add Vegeta.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Cook for another 10 minutes uncovered. When the beans are soft, the soup is ready.<br> 
                If you want it thicker, add more flour. For a thinner soup, add more water.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Season with salt and black pepper. Serve with parsley, bread, feta cheese and pepperoni.</li>
